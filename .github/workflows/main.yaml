-  Create project and upload it to Git

- Go to Action > Dart (configure) > find Flutter Action from Marketplace

- Then Create main.yaml file and add below script:

name: Test, Build and Release apk
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build APK
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'zulu' # See 'Supported distributions' for available options
          java-version: '16'
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2

          token: ${{ secrets.CICD }}
